    <p>I chose a dataset for college education and the job offers you can get from that education. I wanted to see if there was a correlation between college GPA, gender, and what job offers students got based off of those statistics. I decided to use a scatterplot to see this correlation. Using a scatterplot clearly showed what I wanted to see. I have the x-axis as GPA, and I have the y-axis as job offers. We can see each GPA men, women, and people who selected other and how many job offers they got. I could have just used GPA and job offers, but I wanted to see more, I wanted to see if gender had anything to do with it as well. </p>
    <p>This project was very difficult to complete, but I feel accomplished with my work. I had to do a lot of research for the code as well as getting my code to run and creating a website through GitHub for it. I am glad that I got to customize the colors to make it more personalized. I used a pink/purple color for women, blue for men, and green for the students that selected other. I like that the colors can overlap, and that I can see all of the dots for each line. </p>
    <p>Overall, I am glad about the outcome of my code and pleased with my project. I enjoyed doing this and hope I get to do this again in the future! </p>
